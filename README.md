# Coding-Task-Flipr-Bikayi
An app to show Nobel prize winners using Android studio software.

Usingjava as frontend and xml as backend.
And i have fetched the prizes from the url using xml by network-security-config and its domain json file
after i have itirated through the json and added into sqlite database.

I have displayed the name (by adding firstname and surname), year and category
And for filtering i have used flotingbutton right down corner of the screen by clicking it
diloag box would appear for filtering the data.
filtering includes 1.category(instead of dropdown i have included checkbox) and year(from 1900 to 2018.)
and check box for multiple noble awards(more than one).

The file became too large so i converted into zip file.

Note: Add extracted font.zip file to resources in android sutido.
